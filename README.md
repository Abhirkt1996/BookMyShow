Your README.md looks great! It provides a clear overview of the project, installation steps, API usage, and environment variables. Here are a few suggestions to refine it further:

Introduction:

Change "where the user can book a movie with specified seats at a specified slot and get a confirmation that, wheteher booking was sucessful or not" to "where users can book movie tickets with specified seats and time slots, and receive a confirmation of their booking."
Installation:

In the backend setup, clarify that you should create a .env file for environment variables. It helps users understand the need for the .env file.
API Endpoints:

For the GET and POST routes, it‚Äôs helpful to include example requests and responses to provide more context.
Environment Variables:

Add clear instructions on how to obtain and set the API_KEY for MongoDB.
Tech Stack:

Add a section for backend technologies like Express and Mongoose.
Clarify Live and Local Setup:

Make it clear which variables are for live and local setups.
